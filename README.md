# 🎨 SwiftUI Canvas

**Animations created with SwiftUI**  
*Where code becomes motion.*

---

Hello there 👋🏻, I’m **Pramod Kumar** — an experienced **iOS Developer and SwiftUI Advocate** with a strong focus on **animations, motion design, and performance-driven UI**.

**SwiftUI Canvas** is an open-source collection of **high-quality, production-ready SwiftUI animations**.  
Each animation is carefully crafted to demonstrate **clean state management, smooth transitions, and real-world usability** — not just visual flair.

✨ Built for **learning**, **inspiration**, and **real‑world** production use.

> 🎯 **Goal:**  
> To help iOS developers deeply understand SwiftUI animations and use motion to build delightful, modern app experiences.

If you enjoy these animations or learn something new, feel free to ⭐️ the repository and use these concepts in your own apps.
